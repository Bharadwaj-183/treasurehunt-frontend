Hey There!
This file explains you the project

SOFT SKILLS ASSESSED (using subtle methods):

Round 1 requires user to solve riddle. which assesses the CRITICAL THINKING of user.

Round 2 requires user to decode some images and find the word behind it(ELITMUS). The hints in that round were given as 

parts of speech . which assesses the verbal ability of user.

Round 3 requires user to decipher a ceaser text. which assess PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS of user.

Round 4  requires user to find a right door and a right chest in it . For this the user needs to check all the doors and chests. 

which assess the PERSEVERANCE of user.

Round 5 requires user to interpret some symbols and accordingly join all the clues they got. which assess their ATTENTION for DETAIL.

POSSIBLE WAYS TO SOLVE PUZZLE:
1.ROUND 1 

user will be given a riddle. 
After 2 minutes of time a hint button will be available which they can use to solve the riddle.
Answer for round 1 - "treasure"

2.ROUND 2

user will be given an 3 images . 
After 2 minutes of time a hint button will be available which they can use to solve the riddle.
Answer for round 2 - 
1st image means "sum"
2nd image means "tile"
3rd image means reversing them 
that results in "elitmus"


3.ROUND 3

user will be given a ceaser text. user should guess the shift and decipher it. 
the shift is "24" and it is clued in with an "X" moving.
After 2 minutes of time a hint button will also  be available which they can use to decipher the text.

Answer for round 3- "position of x" => 24. 
so shift the ceaser text by 24 letters.
afer 2 mins user will get a hint saying "I don't know why but jack's hat is suspicious."

then if user look at jack's hat there will be a link to click.
clicking that link is the answer.

4. ROUND 4

user is given with multiple doors. user should find the right door among them and also right chest in that door. Remaining doors will be DEADENDS.

upon finding right chest , user is asked to say his best friend's name. 
It is nothing but "jack".


5. ROUND 5 

user needs to rearrange all the clues they got unit now.
they got => AM , AD ,AG , RACS.
hint is given as <- + <- + <- + <- . 
Arranging the clues obtained in previos round("AM" , "AD" , "AG, "RACS") in that manner gives word "madagascar".
answer is "madagascar".


STEPS TO SETUP :

The project is perfectly deployed . no set up needed. 

Backend is deployed at Vercel.

Frontend is deployed at Netlify.


If you want local setup ,then download frontend code from "treasurehunt-frontend" , backend code from "treasurehunt-backend" repositories.



IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:

1.Anyone with an email address can create an Id and password to participate in the game

2.The puzzle must contain
  Minimum 5 clues
  
  Minimum 2 dead-ends
  
  Minimum 1 solution 
  
  
3.All the progress / user data (eg - time taken by each user for every step,  solution accuracy, etc.) depending on your puzzle requirements should be stored  for every user

4.On refreshing, from either browser or website, the puzzle should start from  the same step or give the user an option to restart.

 If user want to continue on same stage , he should click cancel on prompt.
 
 If user wants to restart the he should navigate back to signup page and start.
 
5.A dashboard for the admin where the progress of all the users can be tracked &  analyzed

All the above features are implemented.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:

1.User analytics (eg - time taken by each user for every step, solution accuracy, etc.) depending on your puzzle should be stored and shown in the admin dashboard

A brief note on the logic used to identify if a person has a soft-skill:

*Solving riddles definitely needs CRITICAL THINKING. which is the first round of the app.

*In Second round the hints provided are not direct clues. They are PARTS OS SPEECH which when applied to given images gives the answer.

*Third round is deciphering a cipher text. which needs PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY.

*Fourth round is patiently finding the right door. which assesses the PERSEVERANCE of user.

*Fifth round is finding that they need to rearrange all the clues. which tests their ATTENTION TO DETAIL. 



Thanking you :)
